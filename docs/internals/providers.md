# Provider constraints

Orchestration records intent and state without knowing which provider runs a thread. Provider
protocols, account ownership, permissions, and capabilities belong at the
[adapter boundary](../../apps/server/src/provider/Services/ProviderAdapter.ts). Normalize there
instead of spreading provider checks through reactors and clients.

A driver kind identifies an integration; an instance identifies one configuration and account
lifecycle. Route work by instance, so two accounts using the same driver do not share mutable
session or catalog state.

## Process and account isolation

T3-managed OpenCode chat uses one server per thread. Its MCP registrations are directory-scoped, while
T3's MCP connection is thread-scoped. Sharing a chat server between threads in one directory would
let them replace each other's connection. Catalog and text-generation work can share the
[instance-owned helper](../../apps/server/src/provider/OpenCodeServerOwner.ts), which closes
after an idle period. External OpenCode servers remain externally owned and can require an
external restart to pick up configuration changes.

OpenCode also stores persistent approval grants per directory. Automatic full-access replies use
`once` so they cannot widen a supervised thread's permissions on a shared external server.
See the [adapter](../../apps/server/src/provider/Layers/OpenCodeAdapter.ts).

Antigravity separates account profiles per instance while sharing installed executables across the
environment. It forces file-based credential storage because the native macOS keychain entry would
otherwise be shared across instances. The launch environment removes ambient Google credentials,
so an instance cannot silently use another account or billing project. The agent also resolves
its user-global skill directories under that profile, so the profile links those two directories
back to the user's real `~/.gemini`; MCP servers, hooks, and rules there stay out of the profile.
See [profile isolation](../../apps/server/src/provider/antigravityAuthSupport.ts).

The [Antigravity installer](../../apps/server/src/provider/AntigravityInstallation.ts) outlives
client connections and provider-instance rebuilds. Releases are immutable, with an atomic pointer
selecting the version for new processes. Running processes hold leases on their version. Updates
and removal must respect those leases instead of replacing executables under a running agent.

## Setup must not happen as a health-check side effect

Opening a provider session can start MCP servers, run hooks, or launch a login browser.
[Grok probes](../../apps/server/src/provider/Layers/GrokProvider.ts) avoid authentication and
session creation for this reason. Antigravity likewise reserves authenticated catalog sessions for
explicit setup or model refresh; background checks use initialization only.

[Antigravity sign-in](../../apps/server/src/provider/AntigravityAuth.ts) belongs to the initiating
T3 auth session. The client carries the return URL back to the environment because the provider's
loopback listener may be on another machine. Forward only the callback for the owned pending flow;
a successful callback HTTP request is not proof that provider authentication finished. The native
process owns token exchange and storage.

Antigravity sign-out closes admission to new processes and stops existing processes before clearing account
metadata. Otherwise a helper or resumed session could retain the old account. Cached model lists
do not establish current access, and an authoritative empty catalog must clear the old list.

Antigravity text-generation helpers deny tool requests, but native hooks and MCP configuration can
run before the prompt. They reject profiles with such configuration before launch. Prompt
instructions and tool denial do not create a native sandbox.
See [helper constraints](../../apps/server/src/textGeneration/AntigravityTextGeneration.ts).

## Provider updates run only through the owning installer

A one-click update is offered only when the resolved executable's path proves which installer owns
it. Homebrew and npm are proven by the real path (symlinks followed): a versioned keg or cask under
`brew --prefix`, or `<prefix>/lib/node_modules/<pkg>/` (Windows: the shim beside `node_modules`).
Native installer layouts and the global bin directories of pnpm, Bun, and Vite+ may match on either
the resolved path or its real target, since those installers place real files or their own symlinks
there. Anything unproven stays manual-only but still reports the version gap. npm updates pin
`--prefix` because the `npm` on `PATH` can belong to a different Node than the one that owns the
provider. Homebrew
compares against `brew info` since casks trail npm by hours; native installs share npm's version
train, so the registry stays authoritative for them.
See the [resolver](../../apps/server/src/provider/providerMaintenance.ts).

Ownership is cached per instance and re-read immediately before an update runs. The
[runner](../../apps/server/src/provider/providerMaintenanceRunner.ts) refuses when the lock key
changed since the advisory, and reports success only when the refreshed provider is still installed
with a readable, current version.

## Protocol traps

Codex async questions arrive as notifications and are answered with a new user message. There is
no pending RPC response to send. Blocking questions still use the request/response path. The
[adapter](../../apps/server/src/provider/Layers/CodexAdapter.ts) distinguishes them; the
[decider](../../apps/server/src/orchestration/decider.ts) records an async answer and its user
message together.

An async question can outlive the turn or a server restart. The engine reads that request's
durable activity before resolving it because the in-memory command snapshot omits old activities.
Do not infer that a request has disappeared merely because it is outside the recent window.

Capabilities must describe what the provider can actually do. Antigravity can capture workspace
checkpoints but cannot roll back its conversation. The [checkpoint boundary](./overview.md#turn-completion-and-checkpoints)
therefore rejects revert before touching files. Native permission and question option IDs must
also survive normalization; a display label is not necessarily a valid reply.

## Attachments and stored history

Attachments live outside the project workspace. [ProviderService](../../apps/server/src/provider/Layers/ProviderService.ts)
puts their environment-local paths in turn input and lets adapters choose native input formats.
A path in the prompt does not grant filesystem access. Keep provider sandbox and approval rules
in force; copying uploads into the project to bypass them changes that boundary.

## Compatible API gateway catalogs

Codex and Claude instances can carry an optional `apiGateway` config. This is provider-instance
state, not driver-global state, because two endpoints or API keys can expose different models and
limits. `ApiGatewaySettings` records the inference base URL, an optional catalog URL, catalog
format, authentication mode, and the generated provider environment variable that holds the key.
The UI accepts the opaque key in a password field, then stores it through the sensitive provider
environment path. The config never copies the key value.

[`GatewayModelCatalog.ts`][gateway-catalog] owns server-side discovery and caching. It derives
`/v1/models` from the inference URL unless the instance has an explicit catalog URL. Auto detection
tries Codex, Anthropic, then OpenAI formats and prefers the first result that carries metadata or
reasoning levels. Requests have a five-second timeout and accept at most 5 MiB of JSON text.

The parsers normalize these fields:

| Format    | Container | Context fields                                           | Reasoning fields                                                |
| --------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Codex     | `models`  | `context_window`, `max_context_window`, `max_tokens`     | `supported_reasoning_levels`, `default_reasoning_level`         |
| Anthropic | `data`    | `max_input_tokens`, `max_tokens`                         | `capabilities.effort.*.supported`, plus a supported default     |
| OpenAI    | `data`    | `context_length`, `max_context_length`, completion limit | `thinking.levels` or `supported_reasoning_levels`, plus default |

Each successful response is cached below the provider status cache directory using the instance ID
and a SHA-256 fingerprint of the gateway settings and resolved credential. The raw credential is
never cached. A Codex-format response also retains the original JSON in a separate file for
`model_catalog_json`. Startup loads the cached normalized models before the first network refresh.
A failed refresh keeps the current snapshot and records a nonfatal catalog error. If no cache
exists, provider status uses harness or built-in models plus explicit custom models.

`mergeGatewayModelCatalog` produces the provider snapshot. A successfully fetched or cached gateway
catalog supplements the built-in catalog, including when it is empty. Gateway metadata overrides
matching harness entries, and explicit custom models are appended. Metadata precedence is manual
model override, gateway catalog, harness or built-in value, then unknown.
`contextWindowTokens` means the usable limit for this provider account.
`maxContextWindowTokens` is the theoretical model maximum. The client shows both rather than
treating a model's maximum as an account entitlement.

The Models settings tooltip renders the normalized ID, description, provider, source, context and
output limits, reasoning levels and default, and capability labels. Every visible model also
exposes a metadata editor. A model override and its custom-model list are saved in one settings
update so concurrent UI state cannot drop either value.

### Harness relay

The Codex driver adds a managed `t3_api_gateway` model provider with the Responses wire API. It
normalizes the configured path to end in `/v1`, then passes that provider-specific base URL and the
environment-variable reference through Codex `-c` arguments. A Codex-format response is passed as
`model_catalog_json`, and each new session gets
`model_context_window` for the selected model. T3 sends the selected reasoning effort through the
normal turn request. OpenAI and Anthropic catalog shapes enrich T3's picker but cannot become a
Codex `model_catalog_json` file. Descriptions and maximum-output metadata have no per-turn Codex
setting and remain informational.

The Claude driver sets `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` and
`CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_GATEWAY_MODEL_DISCOVERY=1`. Bearer credentials map to
`ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`; `x-api-key` credentials map to `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. T3 clears the opposite
variable so Claude Code sends only the selected authentication header. T3 resolves the selected
model from the normalized instance catalog before a turn or structured text-generation request, so
manual reasoning choices reach Claude Code. Claude Code does not accept an arbitrary numeric
context-window setting. Usable values above 200,000 select the `[1m]` model form, while smaller
values use the plain model ID. Maximum-output and theoretical maximum-context values remain
informational, and the gateway can still reject `[1m]` based on account entitlement.

## Attachment access

The server stores uploaded attachments in its attachment directory, outside the project workspace.
`ProviderService` adds the absolute path of each attachment to the turn text, then passes every
attachment to the provider adapter. Each adapter decides what its provider ingests natively:

- Codex, Claude, Cursor, and Grok send images as native image inputs and skip generic files. For
  these providers, generic files reach the agent only as file paths in the turn text.
- OpenCode sends PNG/JPEG/GIF/WebP images, text files, and PDFs up to 20 MB as native file parts
  with their real mime type. Everything else (ZIP and other binaries, image formats model APIs
  reject, oversized files) falls back to the file path in the turn text, like the other providers.

Claude receives the attachment directory as an allowed additional directory. Codex keeps its
configured sandbox policy, so access depends on that policy and the selected runtime mode. OpenCode
allows all paths in full-access mode and requests approval for directories outside the workspace in
restricted modes. Cursor and Grok use their own provider permission rules.

The server does not copy attachments into a project or bypass provider approval rules. If an agent
cannot read an attachment, the user must approve the access or select a runtime mode that permits it.

Updated attachment schemas tolerate unknown attachment members, but old image-only clients still
cannot decode messages that contain file attachments. Client file-picking rollouts must account for
this limit.

Do not run an old image-only server against state that contains file attachments. Replay decodes
each persisted event before projection. A file-bearing event can make `ProjectionPipeline` bootstrap
and `OrchestrationEngine` startup fail for the entire environment, not only the affected thread.

## How provider work is requested

Clients never call a provider directly. They dispatch orchestration commands over the RPC method
`orchestration.dispatchCommand`, defined with the rest of the orchestration surface in
[`orchestration.ts`][contracts]. The client-dispatchable provider-facing commands are
`thread.turn.start`, `thread.turn.interrupt`, `thread.approval.respond`,
`thread.user-input.respond`, `thread.checkpoint.revert`, and `thread.session.stop`, plus the mode
setters `thread.runtime-mode.set` and `thread.interaction-mode.set`.

The engine persists an event for the command, and a server-side reactor performs the provider call.
Provider output comes back as internal commands such as `thread.message.assistant.delta` and
`thread.session.set`, which clients observe through `orchestration.subscribeThread`. See
[overview.md](./overview.md) for the command/event loop.

## Server-side workers

Provider work flows through three queue-backed workers. All three are built with
`makeDrainableWorker` from [`DrainableWorker.ts`][worker] and expose `drain` for deterministic test
synchronization.

1. [`ProviderRuntimeIngestion`][ingest] consumes provider runtime streams and emits orchestration
   commands.
2. [`ProviderCommandReactor`][cmd] reacts to orchestration intent events and dispatches provider
   calls.
3. [`CheckpointReactor`][checkpoint] captures workspace checkpoints on turn start and completion, and
   performs reverts.

### Buffered assistant delivery

A thread in `buffered` assistant delivery mode accumulates assistant text instead of streaming each
delta. The buffer is not held until turn completion. In [`ProviderRuntimeIngestion`][ingest],
`MAX_BUFFERED_ASSISTANT_CHARS` is 24,000: the append that would exceed it invalidates the buffer and
spills the whole accumulated text as one delta. The buffer also flushes at interaction boundaries,
when a request opens (approval) or user input is requested, via
`flushBufferedAssistantMessagesForTurn`.
