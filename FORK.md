# t3code Fork

This fork keeps the Windows reliability, durable checkpointing, and workspace capabilities that are still not supplied by the shared base.

Git repository cache keys use Node's native `realpath` so Windows long paths and their 8.3 aliases share one VCS snapshot and refresh history.

## Divergence Log

This is a current-state record only. Each entry describes a surviving difference between `HEAD` and the latest shared base, determined with `git merge-base HEAD upstream/main` (currently `2fb99a7a6`, the upstream parent of the 2026-09-05 merge). A feature adopted from upstream is not a divergence merely because it was involved in a merge.

Keep stable IDs when updating this section; gaps are intentional. When upstream absorbs a difference, remove or rewrite the entry rather than preserving chronology here. Update its behavior, implementation evidence, and validation when the surviving difference changes.

### DL001 — Claude Windows resolver and artifact safeguards

The fork retains the Windows-specific protection around `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk@0.3.170`: when the configured Claude command is a Windows shell shim, the patch selects the bundled native `claude.exe`, while explicit native `.exe` paths continue to work. In a packaged Electron build, the virtual `app.asar` path is remapped to its real `app.asar.unpacked` executable.

The server and desktop artifact builder pin the patched SDK version, including lockfile-free staging, so a build cannot silently resolve an unpatched SDK or fail with an unused-patch error. Provider snapshots and DevTools expose only sanitized resolver diagnostics; startup provenance identifies installed web artifacts without exposing command output or environment values.

**Implementation evidence:** `patches/@anthropic-ai__claude-agent-sdk@0.3.170.patch`, `apps/server/src/provider/Layers/ClaudeProvider.ts`, `apps/server/src/provider/providerSnapshot.ts`, `scripts/build-desktop-artifact.ts`, `scripts/build-desktop-artifact.test.ts`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, and `pnpm-lock.yaml`.

**Recorded validation:** Windows Claude initialization and adapter coverage, server build, `vp check`, `vp run typecheck`, and Windows x64 NSIS packaging with native Claude binaries. The 2026-09-01 integration retained the `0.3.170` patch and exact package and staging pins under focused provider and artifact-builder coverage.

**Last updated:** 2026-09-01

### DL002 — Machine context beside the empty-state hero

The upstream draft hero remains the empty-state headline. The fork adds `On <machine-name>` as its supporting line and uses the same machine label in the existing non-draft empty state. The project already appears in the hero headline, so the supporting line identifies the environment instead of repeating the project name.

**Implementation evidence:** `apps/web/src/components/ChatView.tsx`, `apps/web/src/components/chat/MessagesTimeline.tsx`, and `apps/web/src/components/chat/MessagesTimeline.test.tsx`.

**Recorded validation:** `vp test apps/web/src/components/chat/MessagesTimeline.test.tsx`, `vp check`, and `vp run typecheck`.

**Last updated:** 2026-09-01

### DL003 — Compact Claude and Codex subscription meters

The fork retains session and weekly subscription meters in the active thread header and provider settings cards. A separate best-effort `usage` snapshot supplies these compact meters from Claude and Codex CLI-managed credentials; missing credentials, scopes, network access, or endpoint failures leave it absent without affecting provider health.

Upstream owns the richer `usageLimits` data and the Usage page's Limits tab, including its account and hub sources. The fork's compact presentation remains available alongside that page.

**Implementation evidence:** `packages/contracts/src/server.ts`, `apps/server/src/provider/subscriptionUsage.ts`, `apps/server/src/provider/Drivers/{ClaudeDriver,CodexDriver}.ts`, `apps/web/src/components/SubscriptionUsage.tsx`, `apps/web/src/components/chat/ChatHeader.tsx`, and `apps/web/src/components/settings/ProviderInstanceCard.tsx`.

**Recorded validation:** subscription-usage mapping tests, live Claude and Codex fetcher smoke tests, and contracts/server/web typecheck and lint coverage from the original feature.

**Last updated:** 2026-09-05

### DL004 — Preview navigation and automation hardening

The fork hardens desktop collaborative preview control. A debugger detach invalidates the cached Chrome DevTools Protocol attachment, URL-bearing `preview_open` waits for new and reused tab readiness, and a committed `LoadFailed` state is returned as an automation failure rather than a successful load.

Automation also retries dynamic click/type targets, re-resolves click targets after cursor movement, keeps snapshots coherent across DOM mutations, bounds guest viewport work, and quarantines an unresponsive host so later requests can fail over and recover without reconnecting the environment. Hung native control work now times out below the broker deadline and detaches only its cached debugger session, so the same tab can reattach instead of retaining a blocked control permit.

Browser development's single-origin Vite proxy behavior, including shared and Tailscale origins, is upstream behavior and is not a fork divergence. Explicit IPv4 loopback URLs remain only for the desktop renderer and local-preview automation, where they protect Windows local routing.

**Implementation evidence:** `apps/desktop/src/preview/Manager.ts`, `apps/web/src/components/preview/`, `apps/server/src/mcp/PreviewAutomationBroker.ts`, `apps/server/src/mcp/toolkits/preview/handlers.ts`, and `packages/contracts/src/previewAutomation.ts`.

Upstream owns the pinned Electron debugger reference and bounded screenshot retries. Those fixes compose with the fork's stale-session detection and control deadlines; a screenshot that succeeds on retry keeps its debugger session.

**Recorded validation:** focused desktop preview, web readiness/viewport, broker, MCP, and dev-runner coverage, including same-tab recovery from stalled CDP and capture work, stale-host failover, and `LoadFailed`; `vp check` and `vp run typecheck`. The 2026-09-01 merge-focused suites reran the affected desktop, server, and web preview recovery paths.

**Last updated:** 2026-09-05

### DL005 — Windows portability in CLI fixtures, Git, and tests

The shared fixture launcher dispatches by shebang: shell fixtures use Git for Windows `sh.exe` and Node fixtures use the current Node executable. These dispatch rules and the remaining platform-specific test expectations compose with upstream's broader Windows fixture portability fixes.

Git worktree comparison uses native realpaths and case-folding on Windows so Git for Windows path canonicalization cannot mistake the main checkout for another worktree.

**Implementation evidence:** `packages/shared/src/shell.ts`, `apps/server/src/git/GitManager.ts`, their remaining fork-specific fixture and canonical-path tests, `packages/tailscale/src/tailscale.test.ts`, and `oxlint-plugin-t3code/test/utils.ts`.

**Recorded validation:** targeted Cursor/Grok ACP, provider-runtime ingestion, checkpoint, Git PR-selector, desktop, relay, workspace, Tailscale, and oxlint suites on Windows; `vp check` and `vp run typecheck`.

**Last updated:** 2026-09-05

### DL006 — Durable sidecar checkpoints and recoverable navigation

Checkpoint capture and navigation are durable server services. Private bare-Git sidecars hold opaque `t3-sidecar:v1:` snapshots without modifying the project repository; capture, import, restore, retention, and cleanup are serialized and cover linked worktrees, binaries, symlinks, Windows paths, and non-Git workspaces safely.

SQLite persists capture jobs, immutable checkpoint entries, timeline generations and cursors, provider bindings, retention data, and restart-recoverable navigation journals. Undo, redo, and rewind share a compensating navigation saga; providers without a verified non-destructive branch capability are explicitly limited, and filesystem-only rollback requires confirmation without moving the provider conversation cursor.

Fork migrations `036`–`038` establish durable checkpoint state. The reconciliation migrations retain compatibility with databases that used upstream's overlapping migration numbers. Existing fork history through `052_RemoveManagementApiKeyRuntimeModes` remains unchanged.

Migration `053_ReconcileUpstream47History` repairs a database carrying upstream history through `047`, restoring fork checkpoint and subagent state skipped by the overlapping numbers. Fork management-key and auto-resume migrations remain at `050`–`052`. Incoming upstream behavior then runs as `054_ClearAutomaticProjectModelDefaults`, `055_ProjectionProjectsAutoPull`, `056_RepairAutomaticSettlementTimestamps`, and `057_ProjectionProjectIcon`. Schema checks keep these changes safe for both fork and upstream database histories.

Terminal provider events end the workspace mutation for their exact turn before local VCS status refresh, but the next provider turn remains behind a capture-finalization barrier until that full user/assistant/tool-call turn has been checkpointed and projected. Capture and mutation intervals are serialized instead of preempting one another, preventing normal provider turns from producing `workspace-mutated` checkpoints. A capture waiting for active work releases the worktree gate, so provider turns in other threads can join the same mutation cohort and share its next stable checkpoint boundary; an already-running capture and checkpoint navigation remain exclusive. Aborted turns and provider-turn handoff ownership retain the same exact-owner completion semantics. A stale lease with no active provider turn is recovered automatically; if ownership is ambiguous, the provider turn continues without checkpoint navigation instead of blocking the conversation. Failed mutation-blocked text messages expose a retry action that reuses the persisted user message when available or recreates an optimistic-only message without duplicating it in the UI.

Capture jobs that first lose the workspace-mutation race or fail can be re-enqueued for the same logical turn boundary. The durable row is reset to pending and remains the single job for its snapshot, while pending, running, and ready jobs are still deduplicated.

**Implementation evidence:** `apps/server/src/checkpointing/`, `apps/server/src/persistence/Migrations/{036_CheckpointDurableState,037_CheckpointLegacyMigration,038_CheckpointCaptureProviderMetadata,039_ReconcileCheckpointAndTitleHistory,046_ReconcileUpstream41History,047_AuthSessionClientConnection,048_ProjectionThreadLinkedPullRequest,049_ProjectionThreadsUnsettledAt,053_ReconcileUpstream47History,054_ClearAutomaticProjectModelDefaults,055_ProjectionProjectsAutoPull,056_RepairAutomaticSettlementTimestamps,057_ProjectionProjectIcon}.ts`, `apps/server/src/orchestration/`, `packages/contracts/src/orchestration.ts`, `packages/client-runtime/src/`, and checkpoint-aware web composer and chat components including `ThreadErrorBanner.tsx`.

**Recorded validation:** migration and durability regression matrices, sidecar characterization (including unborn repositories, submodules, and linked worktrees), orchestration integration including serialized full-turn capture, deterministic post-capture lease release, stale-lease recovery, non-blocking checkpoint degradation, and persisted-message retry, Windows isolation slices, upstream-ledger reconciliation through migration `047`, full `vp test`, `vp check`, `vp run typecheck`, and `git diff --check`. The 2026-09-01 merge-focused server tests also covered checkpoint projection and reactor behavior after upstream bounded activity hydration and provider event-lifecycle fixes were integrated.

**Last updated:** 2026-09-05

### DL008 — Persistent multi-thread split workspaces

The fork supports up to four visible thread panes in an equal full-height grid, with focused-pane routing, a shared toolbar, one right panel, and controlled ownership of global keyboard, preview, and composer behavior. Panes can be opened or detached from the sidebar, safely reconcile draft promotion/archive/deletion, and animate layout changes without leaving stale portals or listeners.

Split membership is persisted as multiple ordered local groups with active state and stable group colors. Selecting any member restores its group; the current and legacy sidebars preserve group tinting, support pane and thread drag placement, and show complete left/right drop intent. The group tint is textured with an inline desaturated SVG grain so the color-coded row reads as a surface rather than a flat slab. The grain is a masked pseudo-element rather than a second background layer, because background layers cannot carry their own mask and unmasked grain also covers the gradient's faded tail, flattening the row back into a uniform slab; the overlay shares the tint's fade axis and stops short of its extent so the texture is gone before the color is. Group hues carry a hue-dependent chroma: a flat chroma across the wheel does not read as a flat saturation, since yellow-green renders at full strength while red and blue are gamut-clipped, so chroma eases down around yellow-green. Rows supply only the hue and that chroma, leaving the stylesheet to compose per-theme lightness and strength — light mode takes a deeper, less translucent tint because the translucency that reads as a clear band on the near-black sidebar washes out against zinc-50. The current sidebar also names the other panes in each grouped thread's details tooltip, keeps displayed panes visible when settled or snoozed shelves are collapsed, and preserves split actions in its context menu. Right-panel ownership remains useful when focus moves to a pane with no surface of its own.

**Implementation evidence:** `apps/web/src/splitViewStore.ts`, `apps/web/src/splitViewDrag.ts`, `apps/web/src/components/{SplitThreadWorkspace,SplitPaneDropHint,Sidebar,LegacySidebar,RightPanelTabs,ChatView}.tsx`, `apps/web/src/components/Sidebar.logic.ts`, `apps/web/src/index.css`, `apps/web/src/hooks/useThreadActions.ts`, and the chat routes.

**Recorded validation:** split-store, sidebar, workspace, right-panel, and drag/drop tests; web typecheck; `vp check`; `git diff --check`; and Electron runtime verification of context menus, routing, pane layout, persistent groups, and right-panel attribution. The 2026-09-01 merge-focused web suite reran split ownership and routing against the new composer, attachment, theme, and activity UI.

**Last updated:** 2026-09-01

### DL012 — Prompt preservation during draft promotion

The initial optimistic prompt remains visible while a draft route becomes its server-backed thread. Chat timeline state resets only when the scoped thread identity changes, so the projected `thread.message-sent` event replaces the prompt instead of briefly erasing it. Orchestration commands require an acknowledgement within ten seconds; a lost WebSocket reply therefore enters the existing visible failure path and restores the durable composer draft instead of leaving a refresh-only optimistic message indefinitely.

**Implementation evidence:** `apps/web/src/components/ChatView.tsx` and `packages/client-runtime/src/operations/commands.ts`.

**Recorded validation:** `vp check`, `vp run typecheck`, and the repository `dev` startup smoke test.

**Last updated:** 2026-08-10

### DL013 — Codex availability through catalog and turn failures

Codex model and skill discovery is bounded, optional catalog enrichment after a healthy authenticated app-server session starts. Catalog failure cannot replace that healthy snapshot with a provider-status error.

App-server errors are classified by scope: retryable transport errors remain warnings, while a typed non-retryable turn error emits the terminal failed-turn lifecycle needed to release the thread for a follow-up message. A root Codex collaboration `wait` that remains open for 30 minutes is failed explicitly after bounded child-then-parent interruption; matching item or turn completion cancels that deadline. Actual process or transport failure still marks the session unavailable. Upstream terminal-state, hard-stop, tool-identity, and liveness fixes remain authoritative; in particular, a late collaboration `interacted` event can enrich an existing child without restarting one that already completed.

**Implementation evidence:** `apps/server/src/provider/Layers/{CodexProvider,CodexSessionRuntime,CodexAdapter}.ts`, `apps/server/src/orchestration/Layers/ProviderRuntimeIngestion.ts`, and `packages/contracts/src/providerRuntime.ts`.

**Recorded validation:** focused Codex adapter, collaboration-runtime, provider-runtime ingestion, mixed-tool lifecycle, and transfer-budget tests, `vp check`, and `vp run typecheck`. The 2026-09-01 merge-focused provider suites also covered bounded collaboration waits, turn-scoped failure recovery, and upstream child-model enrichment.

**Last updated:** 2026-09-01

### DL014 — Loadable checkpoint diffs with a legacy baseline fallback

Sidecar summary requests use upstream's NUL-delimited numstat format, including the repository-HEAD compatibility fallback, and reject output overflow rather than publishing an incomplete file list. Full patch requests remain available for the diff viewer.

Turn diff summaries are published only for successfully captured, loadable sidecar checkpoints. Each summary and DiffPanel query compares the completed full turn against the immediately preceding turn boundary; an empty turn remains loadable but produces no diff card. Provider-reported `file_change` items are not synthesized into checkpoint references, and the client hides legacy non-ready rows that cannot load a diff.

Diff queries use the active checkpoint timeline generation and the stable pre-turn sidecar identity. For an older thread with no captured baseline, the remaining compatibility fallback compares against repository `HEAD`. This absorbs only the surviving baseline-fallback behavior from former DL011; provider-derived summary fallback is not retained.

**Implementation evidence:** `apps/server/src/checkpointing/{CheckpointIds,CheckpointDiffQuery,CheckpointStore}.ts`, `apps/server/src/orchestration/Layers/{CheckpointReactor,ProjectionSnapshotQuery}.ts`, `apps/web/src/hooks/useTurnDiffSummaries.ts` with their tests.

**Recorded validation:** focused checkpoint query, nested-worktree, projection, and web-summary tests; rapid multi-turn orchestration integration covering pre-thread changes, consecutive edit turns, a no-edit turn, durable capture, projection summaries, and DiffPanel queries; `vp check`; and `vp run typecheck`.

**Last updated:** 2026-09-05

### DL015 — Live project-scoped working tree diffs

Diff previews for an active project are authorized against that registered project root, including projects outside the server startup directory. The web client no longer substitutes the environment startup repository when the selected project is outside that directory.

While DiffPanel is open, working-tree and branch previews refresh once per second. The panel's Git-status-based scope selection is upstream behavior.

**Implementation evidence:** `apps/server/src/review/ReviewService.ts`, `apps/server/src/ws.ts`, and `packages/client-runtime/src/state/review.ts`.

**Recorded validation:** focused review-service authorization and DiffPanel store tests; controlled-browser reproduction and verification with an external registered project, including a file modification made while the panel remained open; `vp check`; and `vp run typecheck`.

**Last updated:** 2026-09-05

### DL016 — Project-selecting local thread shortcut

The configured Chat: New Local shortcut opens the command palette's "New thread in..." project picker instead of immediately creating a draft in the active project. The same shortcut enters that picker when the command palette already has focus, while the active-project quick-create remains available as a separate palette action.

**Implementation evidence:** `apps/web/src/routes/_chat.tsx`, `apps/web/src/components/CommandPalette.tsx`, `apps/web/src/components/CommandPalette.logic.ts`, and `apps/web/src/commandPaletteBus.ts`.

**Recorded validation:** focused command-palette and keybinding tests; controlled-browser verification from the main app and an already-focused palette; `vp check`; `vp run typecheck`; and `git diff --check`.

**Last updated:** 2026-07-29

### DL017 — Existing-worktree selection for new threads

The new-thread Workspace controls expose a neighboring Worktree selector in Current checkout mode. It defaults to Git's primary checkout and can pin the draft to any existing branched or detached worktree without switching branches or creating another checkout. When the thread materializes, that control becomes an immutable label using the same compact naming: `Main` for the primary checkout, the branch name for branched worktrees, and the seven-character HEAD hash plus `[detached]` for detached worktrees. Locked-thread label resolution uses a one-shot lookup rather than maintaining worktree polling; while that lookup is pending for a detached checkout, the honest fallback is `[detached]`. Git worktree discovery is environment-scoped, uses NUL-delimited porcelain output for path safety, and distinguishes the primary checkout independently of its branch name.

**Implementation evidence:** `packages/contracts/src/git.ts`, `packages/client-runtime/src/state/vcs.ts`, `apps/server/src/vcs/GitVcsDriverCore.ts`, `apps/server/src/git/GitWorkflowService.ts`, `apps/server/src/ws.ts`, `apps/web/src/state/queries.ts`, and `apps/web/src/components/{BranchToolbar,BranchToolbarWorktreeSelector}.tsx`.

**Recorded validation:** focused contract, Git driver, and BranchToolbar logic tests; `vp check`; `vp run typecheck`; and an isolated paired dev-app startup. The live preview rerun was blocked by the unavailable T3 preview host tracked in Papercut #36.

**Last updated:** 2026-07-31

### DL018 — Read-only subagent transcripts in the right panel

Codex collaboration-agent output and Claude Task output are correlated with their native child or
parent tool-use identifiers, persisted separately from the parent assistant stream, and omitted
from the main transcript. Unmatched historical correlations fall back to the main transcript so a
provider routing defect cannot hide a parent response. The spawn remains visible as one native
task lifecycle row; selecting that row or its authoritative Agents-panel entry opens a normal chat
transcript without a composer in the right panel. The provider item remains persisted only for
transcript correlation and does not create a duplicate spawn row. When the provider reports it,
the complete, unchanged spawn prompt is synthesized as the transcript's first user message.

Current Codex multi-agent v2 events can omit the spawn prompt and inline model or reasoning effort.
After child activity registers the thread, the runtime makes one bounded metadata-only
`thread/resume` request with turn history excluded and propagates any returned model and effort
through the native lifecycle. Newer child settings and reroutes remain authoritative over that
snapshot. When a value is still missing, the transcript does not invent it and labels absent model
metadata unavailable. Claude and legacy rich Codex collaboration events retain the complete
metadata. Child plan activity cannot replace the parent plan, and child assistant messages cannot
become the parent turn's checkpoint message. Spawn rows show the reported subagent model and
reasoning effort, while a count-labeled Subagents dropdown between the composer Worktree and branch
controls lists every run and opens its transcript directly. Its label contracts from `N Subagents`
to `N Sub` with the available composer
width. The aggregate label and each menu item's bot icon reflect completed, working, and failed
states; active work breathes, while terminal errors remain static. The composer context strip keeps
the same left-aligned workspace group and right-aligned subagent/branch group at every viewport
width. Native lifecycle-only agents are merged into the same dropdown, and native tool rows
attributed through `agentId` render inside their subagent transcript while remaining hidden from
the parent timeline. Claude output without a parent Task identifier remains in the main transcript.

Projection migration `040_ProjectionSubagentIds` adds durable correlation columns for messages and
activities. Upstream native `task.*` events remain the sole Codex lifecycle and Agents-panel status
authority; child message deltas use the same native agent/thread identity only to populate the
separate transcript. Child thread, turn, name, token, and plan chatter cannot mutate the parent.
Codex app-server builds that report a spawned or resumed child only through the completed
`collabAgentToolCall.receiverThreadIds` provisionally register each non-sender receiver, emit the
native child lifecycle, and scope its subsequent tool and assistant items to that child. Each child
tool keeps its native started/completed rows and complete output alongside task progress. Resume
reactivates an existing child, while later thread-start or subagent-activity metadata enriches the
identity without restarting a settled task. Only root-owned routing items can provision children,
so nested child activity and child-to-root input cannot suppress or pollute the root transcript.
Upstream `sourceActivityKind` semantics and normal-tool collapsing apply to ordinary work-log rows. Fork-owned subagent lifecycle rows remain visible and clickable instead of collapsing away, preserving transcript navigation and native child attribution.

The main timeline names started, messaged, resumed, waited, stopped,
interrupted, failed, and finished subagent operations instead of grouping them under a generic
task label. Only spawn/resume events can establish child routing, so a child message sent back to
the parent cannot capture the parent thread or suppress its final completion. The stale-session
reaper also settles an old active turn when no live provider session owns it, while preserving
genuinely live long-running turns. Fork transcript correlation supports Codex and Claude. Antigravity retains upstream's task and batch presentation.

**Implementation evidence:** `packages/contracts/src/{provider,providerRuntime,orchestration}.ts`,
`apps/server/src/provider/Layers/{CodexSessionRuntime,CodexAdapter,ClaudeAdapter,ProviderSessionReaper}.ts`,
`apps/server/src/provider/Layers/CodexCollabRuntime.integration.test.ts`,
`apps/server/src/orchestration/`, `apps/server/src/persistence/Migrations/040_ProjectionSubagentIds.ts`,
and `apps/web/src/components/{BranchToolbar,ChatView,RightPanelTabs}.tsx`,
`apps/web/src/components/BranchToolbar.logic.ts`,
`apps/web/src/components/chat/{MessagesTimeline,SubagentPanel}.tsx`, `apps/web/src/session-logic.ts`,
and `apps/web/src/rightPanelStore.ts`.

**Recorded validation:** focused Codex and Claude adapter tests, provider-runtime ingestion and
projection migration tests, web session/timeline/right-panel and aggregate subagent-status tests,
package typechecks, `vp check`, `vp run typecheck`, and an isolated paired web-app verification at
narrow panel width. A real Codex 0.146.0 turn also spawned and completed a v2 child through T3,
confirming the canonical spawn activity, child-correlated output, and working-to-completed status
transition. The spawn row, complete prompt where supplied, separate child transcript, completed
status,
status-aware dropdown, invariant context-strip grouping across the former mobile breakpoint, and
absent composer were confirmed in the live client.
The receiver-only Codex v2 path is covered by a focused runtime integration replay that verifies
the synthesized spawn/resume lifecycle, late metadata ordering, parent-route isolation, and
child-scoped tool and assistant items. Adapter and ingestion regressions preserve each child tool's
full native lifecycle and terminal output through projection. The 2026-09-01 integration added
coverage for the single bounded metadata lookup, newer child settings and reroutes, and model and
effort propagation through every task event.

### DL019 — Desktop backend continuity and owned process-tree cleanup

Closing the last desktop window leaves Electron's main process and local T3 backend running. A native OS tray or status item keeps the app discoverable, opens or activates the window, and shows a live count of threads with active foreground or background work. Launching the desktop app again activates or recreates the window against that existing backend, while explicit quit terminates the backend through the owned lifecycle and update and signal shutdown paths retain their normal cleanup semantics. Explicit quit now ignores activation while shutdown is underway and destroys renderer windows before backend cleanup, adopting upstream's cleanup ordering without changing the fork's last-window policy. This is intentionally process-local continuity rather than a detached provider daemon: an Electron main-process crash or OS-forced termination still ends the backend.

The desktop main process owns one shared bearer session per local backend for the window, tray polling, and parallel WSL connections. This preserves upstream's replacement of stale desktop sessions without allowing a tray refresh or another renderer to revoke the active window's login. Closing and reopening the window reuses the backend's shared session.

On Windows, the standalone service launcher terminates the known server PID and its descendants during stop, update, and fatal shutdown. This prevents launcher-owned provider processes from surviving as orphaned Codex writers without scanning or killing processes by name; direct-child signaling remains the fallback when process-tree termination fails.

**Implementation evidence:** desktop lifecycle and native tray/status-item modules and their focused tests under `apps/desktop/src/`, dedicated macOS template-image assets and packaging checks, `apps/server/src/orchestration/http.ts`, `apps/server/src/orchestration/Layers/ProjectionSnapshotQuery.ts`, `packages/contracts/src/environmentHttp.ts`, and `apps/server/src/serviceLauncher.ts`.

Updater-controlled exits retain upstream's synchronous window destruction before process shutdown. Closing the last UI window still keeps the fork's tray-backed backend available.

**Recorded validation:** focused desktop tray, lifecycle, running-count projection, packaging, and Windows process-tree integration tests; Windows notification-area runtime verification of the count, open, and graceful quit controls; `vp check`; `vp run typecheck`; and `git diff --check`. The 2026-09-01 merge-focused desktop and server suites reran tray continuity and running-count behavior with upstream activity-liveness fixes.

The 2026-09-05 authentication fix passed 48 focused tests, including a tray integration regression that fails with the original independent token exchange. An isolated Windows Electron run verified automatic login, continued authentication after tray polling, and closing and reopening the window against the same backend. A separate browser paired successfully with cookie authentication. `vp check` and `vp run typecheck` passed.

### DL020 — Provider turns survive stalled checkpoint captures

Starting a provider turn no longer waits indefinitely when the previous turn has finished but its post-turn checkpoint capture is still pending. In that state, the server dispatches the next turn without a checkpoint mutation so authentication failures and stalled captures cannot freeze the thread. Active provider mutations retain their existing brief handoff grace period. This behavior applies to every provider through the shared command reactor.

Checkpoint workers also reclaim expired leases while the server remains running, retry transient capture errors up to three times, and terminate an executor that exceeds five minutes. Structured lifecycle logs identify the job, thread, boundary, durable attempt, execution attempt, result, and recovery action so capture failures can be diagnosed without inspecting SQLite.

**Implementation evidence:** `apps/server/src/checkpointing/CheckpointCaptureQueue.ts`, `apps/server/src/checkpointing/CheckpointCaptureQueue.test.ts`, `apps/server/src/orchestration/Layers/CheckpointReactor.ts`, `apps/server/src/orchestration/Layers/ProviderCommandReactor.ts`, and `apps/server/src/orchestration/Layers/ProviderCommandReactor.test.ts`.

**Recorded validation:** focused checkpoint queue recovery, retry, timeout, and provider command barrier regressions; `vp check`; and `vp run typecheck`.

**Last updated:** 2026-08-11

### DL021 — Clickable Windows file links in thread Markdown

Thread Markdown preserves local Windows drive-letter destinations through URL sanitization and resolves the encoded backslash form emitted by the Markdown parser. These links open through the existing file chip behavior instead of rendering as inert anchors. This coexists with upstream workspace images, spaced-folder command-click handling, contrast-aware annotation styling, and full-path link tooltips.

**Implementation evidence:** `apps/web/src/components/ChatMarkdown.tsx` and `apps/web/src/markdown-links.test.ts`.

**Recorded validation:** focused Markdown link tests, an isolated paired web-client pass with a drive-letter link in both user and assistant messages, `vp check`, and `vp run typecheck`.

**Last updated:** 2026-08-24

### DL022 — Ephemeral zrok public sharing from Connection Settings

The server owns an in-memory, ephemeral zrok share service. Starting a share prefers the current v2 `zrok2` command and uses legacy v1 `zrok` only when `zrok2` cannot be resolved; it does not fall back after a resolved v2 command fails. It launches `share public --headless --force-local` against a bind-host-aware backend URL: wildcard binds map to loopback while specific IPv4 and IPv6 binds are preserved. It parses zrok's announced HTTP(S) endpoint from either plain or JSON-formatted headless logs and exposes a public endpoint with matching `ws:`/`wss:` access and hosted-HTTPS compatibility. Starts are single-flight and cancellation-safe; launch and stop are serialized in order, readiness has a bounded timeout, unexpected exit becomes a failed status, and stopping or server shutdown terminates the child with signal cleanup. The share is not persisted, and zrok must be available on this server's `PATH`, already authenticated, and enabled. An unavailable state is retryable after the executable or authentication is fixed.

Three environment RPCs expose status, start, and stop. Status observation uses `orchestration:read`; start and stop require `access:write`. Connection Settings shows the share control only when status can be observed, and enables mutation only when both the read and access-write scopes are present. Its access-scope disclosure identifies Manage access as the permission for starting or stopping public zrok exposure; unavailable or failed starts report the PATH/authentication requirement, and stopping requires confirmation because the public URL and dependent pairing links will stop working.

An active zrok endpoint is merged into the advertised endpoint list and is the automatic reachable URL and QR preference, while an explicit user endpoint selection still wins. Pairing URLs preserve the complete token for the zrok HTTPS host; when local network access is unavailable, the zrok endpoint remains available as the remote share route.

**Implementation evidence:** `apps/server/src/remoteAccess/ZrokShare.ts`, `apps/server/src/remoteAccess/ZrokShare.test.ts`, `apps/server/src/startupAccess.ts`, `apps/server/src/{server,ws}.ts`, `apps/server/src/auth/{RpcAuthorization,RpcAuthorization.test}.ts`, `packages/contracts/src/{remoteAccess,rpc}.ts`, `packages/contracts/src/rpc.zrok.test.ts`, `apps/web/src/state/zrokShare.ts`, `apps/web/src/components/settings/ConnectionsSettings.tsx`, `apps/web/src/components/settings/ConnectionsSettings.logic.ts`, and the focused settings/pairing tests.

**Recorded validation:** 38 focused tests cover bind-host targeting, zrok v2/v1 resolution, plain and JSON headless logs, lifecycle ordering, concurrency, cancellation, cleanup, RPC scopes/contracts, endpoint and QR preference, reachable-rail visibility, permission gating, and pairing URLs. An isolated paired web-client pass with an authenticated zrok installation verified start, public reachability, hosted pairing and QR selection, and confirmed stop. Repository-wide `vp check` and `vp run typecheck` pass.

### DL023 — Environment-scoped agent thread tools

Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, Grok, and OpenCode agents can create, list, read, message, and wait
on durable T3 threads in their current environment. These threads are user-visible conversations,
distinct from the providers' internal subagents. New work can stay in the current checkout or use
a new Git worktree. The caller's permission mode applies to a new thread, while a message sent to
an existing thread keeps that thread's mode.

Agents can also list the model choices exposed by currently selectable provider instances,
optionally filtered by driver kind. Results keep provider-instance identity separate from the
driver that runs it and include the current, legacy, and custom models shown in the product model
picker. User-created instances that share a driver remain distinct, and runtime provider changes
are reflected in later calls.

The tools share the server-owned provider MCP credential. They cannot access another environment,
and a thread cannot message itself. Lists default to 50 threads and cap at 200. Reads default to
10 turns, hide output, and cap at 50 turns and 20,000 characters per item. Wait targets are
limited to eight threads and five minutes. A failed worktree bootstrap closes its setup terminal,
deletes the durable thread, removes the worktree when safe, and then removes its generated branch.
Every successful `thread.create`, including bootstrap creation, now drains deletion cleanup through
the create event's sequence before setup or later dispatch continues. The shared
`ThreadCommandDispatcher` owns this fence, so web, mobile, RPC, and agent-tool creation cannot race
an older deletion reactor that is still removing the reused thread or worktree.

**Implementation evidence:** `packages/contracts/src/threadTools.ts`,
`apps/server/src/mcp/{McpHttpServer,McpSessionRegistry,toolkits/threads}/`,
`apps/server/src/orchestration/{ThreadCommandDispatcher,Layers/ThreadDeletionReactor,Services/ThreadDeletionReactor}.ts`,
and the existing product MCP provider integration.

**Recorded validation:** focused thread-tool contract, MCP, model-listing, dispatcher, and Codex
developer instruction tests, plus `vp check` and `vp run typecheck`. Dispatcher coverage verifies
the deletion drain for direct and bootstrapped creation and preserves cleanup order on failed
setup.

### DL026 — Per-instance API gateway model catalogs

Codex and Claude provider instances can declare a compatible API gateway in the add-instance
wizard or provider settings. The server fetches Codex, Anthropic, or OpenAI model catalogs with a
provider-environment credential reference, normalizes model context and reasoning metadata, and
caches the last successful response per instance. The gateway form accepts opaque API keys in a
password field and stores them through the sensitive provider environment path under a generated
safe variable name. It also migrates invalid key values written by the earlier variable-name field.
Gateway settings respect the environment's read-only session controls.
Catalog failure retains cached or provider models and does not make an otherwise healthy provider
unavailable.

Gateway and manual metadata compose with upstream's custom-model display-name and option-descriptor editor.

Turning a Claude instance's gateway off flushes the models it introduced. Because
`claudeModelsFromSettings` always returns the complete built-in catalog synchronously, a
`"disabled"` gateway snapshot is a full inventory, so it is stamped `modelsAuthoritative` alongside
`"network"` and `"cache"`. Without that stamp the snapshot merge treated the built-in list as
non-authoritative and retained the gateway's now-absent models (e.g. GPT slugs) as "missing from the
refresh", leaving them stuck in the picker until the instance's cached snapshot was cleared. Only
`"none"` (gateway enabled but not yet fetched, or a fetch that failed with no cache) stays
non-authoritative so a transient failure keeps previously discovered gateway models. The parallel
Codex path is intentionally unchanged: its inventory depends on an async CLI probe, so a disabled
snapshot is not guaranteed complete.

Models carry usable context, theoretical maximum context, maximum output, and metadata provenance.
Every visible model accepts manual display, context, output, and reasoning overrides; manual values
win over gateway and harness metadata. The Models information tooltip shows every known value
without inventing missing metadata.

The gateway controls remain part of upstream's split provider settings editor. Existing opaque
credentials survive settings refreshes, and the UI replaces or removes a stored key without
round-tripping its value through provider snapshots.

The add-instance wizard keeps its title, description, and step tabs pinned above a single scrollable
step body, with the Back and confirm buttons pinned below, so the long Config step scrolls inside the
dialog instead of overflowing past the viewport.

Codex receives a managed Responses API provider, Codex-format `model_catalog_json`, selected
reasoning effort, and a per-model `model_context_window`. Its adapter normalizes the configured
gateway path to end in `/v1`, so users can enter the gateway origin without knowing Codex's URL
joining rules. Claude receives its gateway environment, gateway discovery flag, selected reasoning
effort, and a context-aware plain or `[1m]` model ID. Metadata with no matching harness control
remains informational.

**Implementation evidence:** `packages/contracts/src/{model,server,settings}.ts`,
`apps/server/src/provider/GatewayModelCatalog.ts`,
`apps/server/src/provider/{Drivers,Layers}/`,
`apps/server/src/textGeneration/ClaudeTextGeneration.ts`,
`apps/web/src/components/settings/{AddProviderInstanceDialog,CompatibleApiGatewaySection,CustomModelMetadataDialog,ProviderInstanceCard,ProviderModelsSection,ProviderSettingsPanel}.tsx`,
and `apps/web/src/components/settings/providerModelDetails.ts`.

**Recorded validation:** focused gateway parsing and cache tests, Codex and Claude provider relay
tests, settings and server contract tests, provider-settings component tests, `vp check`,
`vp run typecheck`, and integrated web verification of gateway configuration, custom model metadata,
and model-detail tooltips. The 2026-09-03 add-instance dialog scroll fix was verified in a browser at
1000x720 and 390x700 with the gateway section expanded. The 2026-09-03 fix also added a Claude
"disabled gateway is authoritative" stamping test and a `mergeProviderSnapshot` regression proving a
Claude instance drops its gateway (GPT) models once the gateway is turned off.

### DL027 — Remote editor links select the server account

Remote open-in-editor targets advertise the operating-system account running the
server when it can be resolved. The web client includes that account inside the
VS Code Remote-SSH authority (`ssh-remote+user@host`), so Windows clients do not
fall back to their local username. Windows AD accounts use `USERDOMAIN\\username`
only when `USERDNSDOMAIN` confirms a domain and the name is not the local
computer/workgroup. Local accounts use the unqualified username. Systems that
cannot resolve an account omit the field and retain host-only behavior.
Desktop-managed SSH aliases remain authoritative and continue to omit the
advertised account. The username field is optional for compatibility with older
server configurations.

**Implementation evidence:** `packages/shared/src/hostProcess.ts`,
`packages/contracts/src/editor.ts`, `apps/server/src/environment/RemoteOpenTargets.ts`,
`apps/web/src/remoteOpen.ts`, `apps/web/src/components/chat/OpenInPicker.tsx`, and
`apps/desktop/src/electron/ElectronShell.test.ts`.

**Recorded validation:** focused contract, server target discovery, web remote-open,
and Electron shell tests.

### DL028 — Isolated Windows x64 GitHub releases

The fork has a manual Windows x64 release workflow that uses GitHub-hosted runners. It builds the
Linux `node-pty` payload required by the packaged WSL backend, produces an unsigned NSIS installer,
and publishes only the Windows installer and updater files to this repository's GitHub Releases.
It does not publish packages, build other desktop platforms, deploy hosted services, announce the
release, or invoke another release workflow.

The packaged local server remains available. Remote server self-update to the fork version is not
available because this workflow deliberately does not publish a matching `t3` package.

**Implementation evidence:** `.github/workflows/fork-windows-release.yml`.

The Windows job also uses upstream's corrected Visual Studio Spectre runtime component identifier when installing packaging prerequisites.

**Recorded validation:** workflow syntax and action-policy checks, `vp check`, and
`vp run typecheck`.

**Last updated:** 2026-09-05

### DL029 — User messages promote active sidebar threads

The current sidebar moves an active thread to the top when the user sends it a new message. Other thread updates do not change its position. Creation and un-settle timestamps remain lifecycle anchors, and equal anchors use environment and thread IDs for deterministic ordering.

**Implementation evidence:** `apps/web/src/components/Sidebar.logic.ts`, `apps/web/src/components/Sidebar.logic.test.ts`, `packages/client-runtime/src/state/threadSort.ts`, and its thread-sort tests.

**Recorded validation:** focused shared, web, and mobile thread-sort tests covering user-message promotion, non-message updates, creation fallback, un-settle re-entry, and deterministic ties; `vp check`; and `vp run typecheck`.

**Last updated:** 2026-09-05

### DL030 — Isolated macOS GitHub releases

The fork has a manual macOS release workflow that uses GitHub-hosted `macos-15` runners. It builds
unsigned, non-notarized DMG and ZIP artifacts for Apple Silicon and Intel, merges the per-arch
updater manifests into one `latest-mac.yml`, and publishes only those files to this repository's
GitHub Releases. Like DL028 it does not publish packages, build other platforms, or deploy hosted
services, and it does not publish a matching `t3` package.

Because the build is unsigned, Gatekeeper blocks first launch until the user opens the app via
right-click → Open or clears the quarantine attribute, and in-app auto-update does not work. Signing
and notarization need a Developer ID certificate (`CSC_LINK`/`CSC_KEY_PASSWORD`), an App Store
Connect API key (`APPLE_API_KEY*`), and for passkeys an `APPLE_TEAM_ID` plus provisioning profile;
the workflow can adopt upstream's `--signed` path once those secrets exist.

**Implementation evidence:** `.github/workflows/fork-macos-release.yml`.

**Recorded validation:** actionlint, `vp check`, and `vp run typecheck`.

**Last updated:** 2026-09-03

### DL031 — Durable management API keys for external MCP clients

Management-key HTTP requests use request-time authorization and relay endpoint resolution, including one credential renewal retry for an invalid credential. Insufficient-scope errors do not retry. Bearer and DPoP requests explicitly omit browser cookies so a stale session cookie cannot override the selected environment credential; cookie-authenticated requests continue to include cookies. Regression coverage checks the credential modes and reproduces the collision against the server.

Integrations settings can select any known machine and create environment-wide management API keys
there with named read-only, thread-orchestration, or custom scopes and explicit expiration. The
selected environment's prepared HTTP connection supplies its own URL and
cookie, bearer, or DPoP authorization, so listing and every mutation reach the chosen machine. A
disconnected machine stays selectable but cannot mutate keys. The secret is revealed only once
after creation or rotation; list rows retain only a display prefix and key metadata, while rotation
invalidates the previous secret and revocation takes effect immediately.

Direct pairing preserves the scopes carried by the pairing credential instead of always requesting
the standard client scope set. Standard links therefore remain constrained, while an administrative
startup link can manage keys on the paired machine without inventing or broadening privileges.

The existing HTTP MCP endpoint accepts these persistent keys alongside ephemeral provider-session
credentials and enforces one management scope per thread operation. Management callers can select
projects, create and message threads, read and wait on threads, and list models. Runtime permissions
belong to threads rather than keys: external creation uses the normal T3 Code default and messages
keep the target thread's current mode. Management keys cannot use preview automation or environment
administration. State-changing
orchestration events retain the key ID and name without retaining its secret or display prefix.

Effect MCP registers tools server-wide, so `tools/list` still advertises preview tool names to a
management client. Preview handlers require a provider-session principal and reject every management
key call. Keeping that authorization check at the handler boundary avoids a transport-level response
rewriter and matches the MCP plan's fallback for server-wide registration.

The settings surface includes copyable generic JSON HTTP MCP and Codex `bearer_token_env_var`
examples, and keeps the one-time secret in transient dialog state only. Persistence stores a SHA-256
hash of each token, checks expiration and revocation on authentication, throttles last-used writes,
and coordinates concurrent resolution, rotation, and revocation without exposing two active
secrets.

**Implementation evidence:** `apps/web/src/components/settings/ManagementApiKeysSettings.tsx`,
`apps/web/src/components/settings/ManagementApiKeysSettings.logic.ts`,
`apps/web/src/environments/managementApiKeys.ts`,
`packages/client-runtime/src/state/managementApiKeys.ts`,

`apps/server/src/mcp/toolkits/threads/handlers.ts`, `packages/contracts/src/managementApiKeys.ts`,
and `docs/user/thread-tools.md`.

**Recorded validation:** focused persistence, migration, service concurrency and interruption,
administration HTTP, MCP authentication, provider-session regression, scope enforcement, preview
denial, thread-handler, attribution, contracts, and settings UI tests. An isolated paired web client
created, rotated, and revoked a key; a real external MCP client used it to list models and threads,
create, read, message, and wait on a Codex thread; the old rotated token and revoked replacement both
returned the generic 401 response. Database and log inspection confirmed hash-only persistence and
key-ID/name-only event attribution. A two-server web pass paired an administrative remote
environment, created separate keys on the primary and remote machines, showed each machine's own
MCP endpoint, kept the two lists isolated while switching the selector, and revoked both disposable
keys. Repository-wide `vp check` and `vp run typecheck` passed.

### DL032 — Automatic resume after native provider usage limits

Auto-resume is enabled by default for all threads and can be turned off under **Settings →
General → Auto-resume after usage limits**. When native Claude Code or Codex reports an exact
future reset time for a failed turn, the server stores one durable resume job for that thread and
sends scoped automatic-resume instructions three seconds after the reset. Before dispatch, the
server checks the durable message projection for the stable resume message ID. Stable schedule,
command, and message identifiers make the job safe to recover after a server restart without
sending the continuation twice. A newer turn, message, provider selection, active request, archive,
deletion, or explicit settle makes the saved job stale instead. Transient dispatch failures retry
after another three seconds.

Claude uses the rejected native `rate_limit_event` reset. Codex confirms native
`usageLimitExceeded` errors through `account/rateLimits/read`. Generic `429` responses from
compatible API gateways do not expose an authoritative reset through either CLI, so gateway usage
limits are intentionally unsupported.

**Implementation evidence:** `packages/contracts/src/{orchestration,providerRuntime,settings}.ts`,
`apps/server/src/provider/Layers/{ClaudeAdapter,CodexAdapter,CodexSessionRuntime}.ts`,
`apps/server/src/orchestration/Layers/{AutoResumeReactor,ProviderRuntimeIngestion}.ts`,
`apps/server/src/persistence/{Layers,Services}/AutoResumeJobs.ts`,
`apps/server/src/persistence/Migrations/051_AutoResumeJobs.ts`, and
`apps/web/src/components/settings/{SettingsPanels,settingsSearch}.ts*`.

**Recorded validation:** focused native Claude and Codex reset parsing, provider-runtime,
settings-contract, and server-settings tests.

### DL033 — Client-side prompt queue for sequential follow-up turns

While a turn is running, the composer can queue follow-up prompts (up to 10 per
thread) that each fire as their own fresh turn once the thread goes idle. This is
distinct from steering, which is preserved: while a turn runs, both the new
"Queue" button and pressing Enter hold the prompt to run after completion, while
the running-send button still steers text into the running turn. The queue drains only into
a genuinely idle thread — it pauses on a running turn, a pending approval, a
pending user-input request, a connecting/unavailable environment — so an
auto-fired follow-up never buries blocked-on-you work. A failed dispatch restores
the prompt to the head of the queue and pauses auto-dispatch on it to avoid a hot
retry loop.

The queue is client-side and persisted per device (localStorage), keyed by the
thread's scoped ref, so it survives reload but does not sync across devices or run
while the app is closed. It drains for the thread currently open in the chat view.
Queued prompts are text-only in this revision (attachments and composer contexts
stay in the composer). The pure queueing rules and the idle-dispatch decision live
in `client-runtime` so a future mobile surface can reuse them; mobile is a
deliberate follow-up because it already ships a separate durable thread-outbox with
its own delivery semantics.

**Implementation evidence:** `packages/client-runtime/src/state/promptQueue.ts`
(+ test), `apps/web/src/promptQueueStore.ts` (+ test),
`apps/web/src/components/chat/PromptQueueList.tsx`,
`apps/web/src/components/chat/ComposerPrimaryActions.tsx`,
`apps/web/src/components/chat/ChatComposer.tsx`, and
`apps/web/src/components/ChatView.tsx`.

**Recorded validation:** focused queue-core and web-store unit tests; repo-wide
`vp check` and `vp run typecheck`.

## Merge History

This is an append-only historical decision record. It provides context for integrations but never, by itself, establishes an ongoing fork divergence; use the current Divergence Log for that determination.

Don't forget to update the `base` tag after each merge to track the latest shared base with upstream/main.

### 2026-09-07 — Merge feat/composer-prompt-queue into main

**Merge commit:** this merge commit
**Parents:** `b0c03c3c354a5764e32dc30779e4a6a752a1895f` (main, synced with upstream through `2fb99a7a6`) and `2e9b28c2cb3db85fe6267cc57710edf5493c5eaa` (feat/composer-prompt-queue)

Consolidated the fork's in-progress feature branch into main after fast-forwarding main to the pulled origin state. The branch carried the DL033 client-side prompt queue (with the follow-up refinement that Enter queues while a turn is running) and the DL026 Claude "disabled gateway is authoritative" fix.

- Kept both sides where the branch and the newer main touched the same code. In `ProviderRegistry.test.ts` and `ChatComposer.tsx`, the branch's additions (`queueComposerPrompt`, the disabled-gateway regression test) sat next to unrelated new main code (`submitCitationAndSend`, the "drops custom models" test); both were preserved as independent members.
- In `ChatView.tsx`, took main's newer `isWorking` (extended with `isCompacting`) and its compaction-tracking block, and layered the branch's prompt-queue state on top, discarding the branch's stale `isWorking` duplicate.
- Renumbered the branch's prompt-queue Divergence Log entry from DL028 to DL033 because main had since claimed DL028–DL032 (isolated Windows/macOS releases, sidebar promotion, management keys, auto-resume). Merged the DL026 gateway notes and validation records from both sides.
- Dropped the branch's duplicate PR-filter and `cli-external-packages` `Set`-lookup edits in favor of the byte-identical versions main already carried.
- Verification and the resulting 0.0.38 release build are recorded below / in the release artifacts.

### 2026-09-05 — Merge upstream/main into main

**Merge commit:** this merge commit
**Parents:** `e6d4fa2ce8b0f7c8d6c597b221ab6e70882bcb8e` (fork) and `2fb99a7a664faf045f1884f38c620016b34874cb` (upstream/main)

- Preserved deployed fork migrations `036` through `052`. Migration `053` reconciles overlapping upstream history; incoming project defaults, auto-pull, settlement timestamp repair, and project icons run as `054` through `057`.
- Retained durable sidecar checkpoints, navigation barriers, child transcript correlation, split workspaces, API gateway catalogs, management keys, and automatic usage-limit resume. Sidecar summaries now use upstream numstat parsing, including the repository-HEAD fallback.
- Adopted upstream Usage and Limits, provider authentication and catalog changes, Antigravity presentation, async-question retention, replay and settlement fixes, panel lifecycle, custom-model editing, citations, and media updates. Compact fork subscription meters remain alongside Limits. Retired DL024 and DL025 because upstream now provides progressive Usage results and service-file durability.
- Restored upstream primary-turn pull-request refresh while retaining fork branch-specific status refresh. Removed the unreachable legacy revert handler; normalized checkpoint commands run through the durable navigation reactor.
- Retained the patched Claude SDK at `0.3.170` and handled newer wire values structurally. Fixed ACP completion draining exposed by the merged Grok tests. Management-key requests now share upstream request-time DPoP renewal and relay endpoint refresh; read-only sessions cannot edit gateways.
- Preserved desktop tray-backed backend lifetime and preview reattachment safeguards while adopting synchronous updater window destruction, pinned debugger capture retries, and Linux browser-secret packaging. Windows release setup uses upstream's Spectre runtime component. Timeline status indicators use the app tooltip component.
- Validation passed provider/contracts, web, mobile, client-runtime, desktop, packaging, backend, and migration tests. Final focused checkpoint and navigation suites passed 59 tests, checkpoint storage passed 24, and migration reconciliation/repair passed 3. Repository-wide `vp check` and `vp run typecheck` passed. `vp run lint:mobile` completed, but SwiftLint, ktlint, and detekt were unavailable and skipped.
- An isolated copy of the real database migrated through `057`, passed SQLite integrity checks, and retained all 52 existing threads. A paired web client completed two real Codex turns, loaded the correct sidecar diff, opened and detached split panes, loaded Usage costs and rendered Limits at desktop and phone widths, persisted and removed a gateway setting, and created and revoked a temporary management key. A narrowed session-response fixture verified read-only gateway controls block interaction. Files-only checkpoint restore changed the isolated project's file to its earlier contents while preserving chat history. No browser exceptions occurred during these final flows. Native mobile runtime verification was unavailable because this Linux host has no Android SDK or emulator and cannot run iOS Simulator.

### 2026-09-01 — Merge upstream/main into main

**Merge commit:** this merge commit
**Parents:** `51acfe8775be51bf6937c2c998e5770bd52e2515` (fork) and `0bfb6df34b26dfe0162db6c09dca00bc8c5a5ec4` (upstream/main)

The integration made these semantic choices:

- **Providers and credentials:** preserved the fork's patched and pinned Claude SDK, Claude and Codex subscription usage, per-instance API gateway catalogs, normalized Codex Responses URL, and opaque gateway credential UI. Adopted upstream OpenCode ownership, child approvals and stops, provider catalog refresh, project-default model handling, and the split provider settings editor.
- **Checkpoints and subagents:** retained durable checkpoint navigation, child-scoped transcripts, receiver-only Codex routing, parent transcript isolation, and bounded root collaboration waits. Adopted upstream Codex child model lookup and kept newer child settings and reroutes authoritative.
- **Thread lifecycle and remote access:** retained zrok sharing, environment-scoped thread tools, tray-backed desktop continuity, and liveness-aware running-thread counts. Centralized the post-create deletion drain in `ThreadCommandDispatcher`, so every thread creation waits for older deletion cleanup before bootstrap work continues.
- **Preview:** retained debugger reattachment, bounded native control work, stale-host quarantine, URL readiness, `LoadFailed` propagation, and same-tab recovery while adopting upstream preview recording, popup, battery, and agent-created-thread fixes.
- **Web and mobile:** adopted upstream generalized web attachments, mobile upload and file sharing, native image, PDF, and video preview, environment themes, composer and activity presentation changes, settings search, pull-request filters, and Expo 57 with React Native 0.86.3. Fork split workspaces, checkpoint controls, subagent navigation, and Windows file links remain composed with those changes.
- **Authentication, analytics, and performance:** adopted upstream DPoP diagnostics and replay handling, connected-client analytics, bounded activity payload loading, reduced full tool-output hydration, lower idle CPU use, and provider event-listener cleanup.
- **Post-merge QA:** merge-focused validation passed 403 server and contracts tests, 548 web tests, 26 mobile tests, and scoped lint and typechecks. Repository-wide `vp check`, `vp run typecheck`, and `vp run lint:mobile` passed. An isolated paired web client verified the merged draft composer, provider subscription and gateway settings, opaque-secret handling, and environment themes through Chrome CDP with no browser exceptions. Representative mobile emulator verification was unavailable because this Linux host has no Android SDK or ADB and cannot run iOS Simulator tooling.

### 2026-08-28 — Merge upstream/main into main

**Merge commit:** this merge commit
**Parents:** `f3caafe741e9ca21d48788803a9e202c97d6d1ce` (fork) and `f6f2be32d8bc072e87753e41ad77c7c67e8b0b95` (upstream/main)

The integration made these semantic choices:

- **Persistence migrations:** kept deployed fork migrations `036` through `047` in place and assigned upstream linked-pull-request and unsettled-thread migrations to `048` and `049`, with schema guards and ledger coverage.
- **Providers and orchestration:** adopted upstream approval, interrupt, session recovery, Codex 0.150, Claude, and Grok fixes while retaining checkpoint barriers, receiver-only Codex child routing, child transcript isolation, and environment-scoped durable thread tools.
- **Git and thread startup:** retained existing-worktree selection and the fork's cleanup-aware shared thread dispatcher, then added upstream missing-worktree recreation, push-base protection, worktree pruning, and submodule initialization.
- **Web and mobile:** adopted uploads, HEIC conversion, file reveal, linked pull requests, settle restoration, usage sorting and filtering, and current layout fixes while retaining split-pane composer ownership, checkpoint navigation, clickable subagent transcripts, and progressive multi-environment usage.
- **Desktop and packaging:** retained tray-backed backend continuity, Windows process and Claude safeguards, and lockfile-free patch pinning while adopting upstream macOS signing, preview release, Clerk, and dependency-staging changes.
- **Post-merge QA:** conflict and regression suites passed, including migrations `048` and `049`, Git and provider integration, progressive usage, desktop packaging, and the transfer-budget test rerun in isolation. `vp check`, `vp run typecheck`, `vp run lint:mobile`, and `git diff --check` passed. An isolated paired web client rendered progressive usage and the merged draft composer. Mobile emulator verification was unavailable because this Windows host has no Android SDK or ADB.

### 2026-08-24 — Merge upstream/main into main

**Merge commit:** this merge commit
**Parents:** `2382ae6d4824f4eea30d96404f7b22df5309c05e` (fork) and `b4be33f0747445f1c9df126e932c7b9792f322d5` (upstream/main)

The integration made these semantic choices:

- **Persistence migrations:** preserved deployed fork migrations `036`–`045`, added idempotent migration `046` to reconcile databases that previously followed upstream through `041`, and assigned upstream auth-session client metadata to `047`.
- **Providers and orchestration:** adopted upstream feedback upload, hard-stop handling, lifecycle identity, liveness, mixed-tool failure, and terminal-state fixes while retaining fork checkpoint navigation, provider health behavior, receiver-only Codex child routing, Claude child persistence, and parent transcript isolation.
- **Tool and subagent UI:** adopted upstream work-log source semantics and collapsing for ordinary tools while retaining visible, clickable fork subagent rows, transcript actions, native lifecycle metadata, and split-pane/right-panel ownership.
- **Composer and Markdown:** combined upstream skill menus, background thread creation, draft recovery, workspace images, link tooltips, and appearance contrast with fork checkpoint commands, prompt preservation, workspace context, and Windows drive-letter links.
- **Desktop and preview:** retained last-window backend continuity and bounded preview automation recovery while adopting upstream explicit-quit cleanup, activation guard, hidden-preview throttling, and current updater behavior.
- **Git, dependencies, and packaging:** kept existing-worktree selection, patched Claude SDK pinning, native binary exclusions, and zrok sharing alongside upstream remote default-branch, pull-request association, Clerk, release, and package updates.
- **Repository cleanup:** adopted upstream removal of obsolete plans, PR assets, preview loading helpers, marketing architecture helpers, and superseded skill-presentation helpers.
- **Post-merge QA:** focused conflict and regression suites passed, including the upstream-ledger migration through `047`, provider/orchestration contracts, web/mobile timeline behavior, desktop lifecycle/preview, and the rebaselined per-snapshot transfer budget. `vp check`, `vp run typecheck`, and `vp run lint:mobile` passed on Node `24.13.1`; the mobile wrapper skipped unavailable SwiftLint, ktlint, and detekt binaries. An isolated paired web client rendered the merged command/skill UI, created a real thread, and received a provider response. Representative mobile emulator verification was unavailable because this Windows host has no Android SDK or ADB and cannot run iOS Simulator tooling.

- **Persistence migrations:** preserved deployed fork migrations `039`–`043` and assigned upstream project default-environment and favicon migrations to `044`–`045`, including their loader, ledger, and focused test references.
- **Providers:** adopted upstream's Codex missing-rollout recovery and hermetic Claude fixture while retaining fork collaboration wait handling, subagent routing assertions, patched Claude SDK resolution, and subscription usage.
- **Right panel and workspaces:** retained split-pane ownership, pane-local composer routing, checkpoint navigation, and subagent source attribution while adding upstream pull-request surfaces, file drops, maximization, favicons, and sidebar behavior. Persisted right-panel state now uses version `12`.
- **Remote access and authorization:** kept the zrok service and its RPC scopes alongside upstream remote-open targets, pull-request services, project access controls, and permission-aware UI.
- **Preview:** adopted upstream browser-default/open behavior and favicon lifecycle while retaining navigation readiness, `LoadFailed` propagation, stale-host recovery, and diagnostics reset on navigation.
- **Usage and packaging:** retained printable `\u001f` usage keys with upstream hourly four-part buckets, preserved fork Claude/mobile patches with upstream Clerk and dependency updates, and kept patched-version pinning inside upstream's split desktop staging sets.
- **Agent policy:** adopted upstream's removal of the rebase-before-PR rule while preserving this fork's explicit-consent and semantic-sync requirements.
- **Post-merge QA:** passed `vp check`, `vp run typecheck`, the mobile native static-check wrapper, focused server/web/desktop suites, and a fresh isolated migration through `045`. The authenticated web shell rendered, but interactive web automation was unavailable after the T3 preview host detached; mobile emulator verification and platform-native linters were unavailable on this Windows host because the Android SDK and native lint tools are not installed.

**Parents:** `cb54c741c0005c27b57894f6829cd590e6965b17` (fork) and `2c7267ad43a05cf3e30343400c76fd9ac47698e7` (upstream/main)

**Latest-tip merge commit:** `b20da786b74b45e74d52d4f6360d69b326dbb123`
**Parents:** `c6660dec6dd6e42ffed0cc4fb6a95fb24defbd74` (integrated fork) and `8101cd044911c7dc2a2adf7c7a9ba7962abf57b6` (upstream/main)

The integration made these semantic choices:

- **Subagent observability:** adopted upstream's native `task.*` lifecycle and Agents surface as authoritative while retaining fork child-scoped transcript persistence and transcript access from matching native agent rows. Child messages remain outside the parent web and mobile feeds.
- **Codex child lifecycle:** retained native task progress, usage, idle/resumable state, and reaper liveness while also finalizing child assistant output into the fork transcript without mutating parent turn, diff, or checkpoint state.
- **Persistence migrations:** preserved fork migrations `036`–`040`, moved upstream pinning and pagination migrations to `041`–`043`, and kept migration `039` as the idempotent repair path for databases carrying the upstream `036`–`038` ledger.
- **Checkpoint pagination:** combined fork checkpoint navigation and cursor behavior with upstream bounded thread snapshots; clients retain the complete requested turn window across cache rehydration and navigation refreshes.
- **Sidebar and split workspaces:** followed upstream's `SidebarV2` to `Sidebar` promotion while retaining fork split-group styling, drag/detach behavior, accessibility, and context actions alongside upstream pinning.
- **Authorization and session safety:** retained workspace-root authorization for review file reads and ordered background-agent liveness ahead of orphaned-turn cleanup so a live child cannot be stopped accidentally.
- **Latest upstream additions:** integrated desktop preview zoom controls, the consolidated mobile thread-settings sheet, and cross-environment provider transcript usage reporting without replacing surviving fork behavior.
- **Post-merge QA:** fixed snapshot identity decoding, checkpoint-navigation delivery, cached pagination width, child transcript propagation and live-follow, mobile child-message filtering, Windows transfer-test timing, and source NUL delimiters found by focused tests, live paired verification, and independent Opus review.

### 2026-07-27 — Merge upstream/main into main

**Merge commit:** `e9ef500ee4f779df65864f0c0e5c599bb740b870`
**Parents:** `a193276b47626a2556690408a87e4eab7325ea1e` (fork) and `23b55022175e69938514934f65c5a607d38f1e47` (upstream/main)

The merge reconciled the following textual conflict surfaces and made these semantic choices:

- **Agent guidance:** combined both `AGENTS.md` verification requirements rather than dropping either workflow.
- **Persistence migrations:** retained fork checkpoint migrations `033`–`036` and placed upstream settled/snoozed projection migrations at `037`–`038`, resolving the migration-number collision without rewriting existing fork installations.
- **Checkpoint and lifecycle projections/contracts:** merged checkpoint commands, cursor-aware projection, and durable state with upstream settled/snoozed thread projection and the corresponding contracts and schemas.
- **Provider lifecycle:** preserved explicit provider starting/error states while treating catalog enrichment and turn-scoped errors as nonfatal for an otherwise healthy session; only genuine startup, process, or transport failure makes it unavailable.
- **Claude executable handling:** selected the upstream resolver as the primary path and retained the fork's packaged `app.asar.unpacked` fallback, patched SDK pinning, and sanitized diagnostics for Windows artifacts.
- **Sidebar and split workspaces:** adopted Sidebar V2 while retaining persistent split groups, split actions, and displayed panes remaining open when settled or snoozed shelves are collapsed.
- **Draft empty state:** kept the upstream draft hero, retained prompt preservation during promotion, and placed the fork workspace/location context as the supporting line.
- **Timeline minimap:** chose the upstream side-gutter minimap and dropped the obsolete fork `w-5` minimap-width change.
- **Preview behavior:** adopted upstream preview URL and color-scheme behavior while retaining fork navigation readiness, `LoadFailed` reporting, host failover, and recovery hardening.
- **Development addressing:** adopted upstream browser single-origin and Tailscale behavior; explicit loopback remains limited to desktop and local-preview paths.
- **Root helpers:** retained both sets of root helper configuration instead of treating either as a replacement.
- **Cross-platform test coverage:** merged `/userdata` and Windows portability coverage so desktop, server, and shared tests use platform-correct paths and fixtures.
- **QA reconciliation:** merged command, schema, and test-fixture changes and fixed Claude/Codex cleanup issues discovered during post-merge validation.
